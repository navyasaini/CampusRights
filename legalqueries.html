        <u>
        PROPERTY LAW</u><br><br>
        (1) How can a person transfer property ownership to a family member as a gift?<br>
        The giving of property to a receiver  by  the  willingness of transferor without any motive of wanting compensation in return is called “Gift”.
        According to  Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 , you can transfer immovable property through a  gift deed . A gift deed contains the details of the property,  the transferor, and the recipient
        A gift deed is a legal document that describes the voluntary transfer of a gift from a donor to the donee (receiver ). The donor should not be bankrupt and should not use this as a tool for dodging of tax and illegal gains.
        Under the laws in India (Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 and Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act.), registering a gift deed with the sub-registrar is mandatory . If not done, the transfer will be invalid. 
        For property to be a valid gift, the following should be kept in mind<br>
        1. It should be movable or immovable property.<br>
        2. It must be transferable.<br>
        3. It should be an existing property and not a future property.<br>
        4. It should be tangible or real.<br>
        5. The transferor and the receiver should be alive at the time of the gift.<br>
        A person who owns the property can make a gift to another person. An exception to this rule is the case in which either the benefactor or the donee is a minor. Minors are not eligible to transfer property as a gift. 
        <br><br><hr> (2) What are the legal implications of adverse possession in property law?<br>
        In India , the concept of Adverse Possession means that a trespasser or a stranger who comes into possession of the land must be in exclusive and continuous possession , without any interruption for a certain period of time (12 to 30  years) of the land. 
        The law of Adverse Possession is contained in the Article 65 Sch-I of the Limitation Act, 1963 which prescribes a limitation of 12 years for a suit for possession of an immovable property or any interest therein based on title.
        The Limitation Act 1963 is a key piece of legislation elaborating on adverse possession. Under Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 no cognizance can be taken by the Court if the suit is barred by limitation whether the defense is taken by the defendant or not. However an exception prevails  regarding extinguishment of right under the Limitation Act, 1963 as provided under Section 27 which provides that in case the person has not taken any action for recovery of possession during the period of limitation then his rights get extinguished. 
        But the law of adverse possession is based upon the principle that a land cannot be left in suspension for a long time as already stated above. 
        
        <br><br><hr>
        (3) What are the legal requirements for drafting and executing a valid property deed?<br>
        In case of property transactions, various types of deeds need to be pulled up. These may relate to agreement to sell, sale agreement, power of attorney etc. The  basic points that need to be taken into account while drawing out these legal documents include:
        <br>1. The names of the parties such as buyer and seller, lessor and lessee etc<br>
        2. Terms and conditions related to the sale or transfer of property.<br>
        3. Details of the parties<br>
        4. Details of property in question<br>
        5. Sale consideration agreed on <br>
        
        
        The deeds should be prepared on non-judicial stamp paper of requisite value as prescribed by the Stamp Act of the State concerned. The purchaser is liable to pay the stamp duty in accordance with the applicable stamp rules. 
        
        
        All pages of the deed must be signed. The deed should be witnessed by at least two spectators giving their full names, signatures, essentials and addresses. Most deeds related to immobile property need obligatory registration at the jurisdictional sub-registrar's office. All the parties concerned need to be present at the time of registration. All documents should be presented in original.
        <br><br><hr> (4) Explain the process of property title search and it’s important?<br>
            The term title search refers to the inspection of public records to determine and confirm a property's  legal ownership. Title searches are conducted through many foundations, including deeds, tax liens, land    records, court judgments, among others. 
          A clean title is required for any real estate transaction to be completed. Transactions cannot be completed if a title search determines there is a spleen on the property.
          <br>The Process for a Title Deed is
        Title searches are normally conducted using a title company. This company is responsible for searching through public records to see if there are any liens against a property. 
        The usual title search can take anywhere between 10 and 14 days to complete. But it may take longer for title searches to be executed on older properties.

         Drafting Of a Plaint<br>
        The filing of a plaint is the primary step in commencing a civil suit. A plaint is, to put it simply, a formal allegation made by one party against another. The party who files such a plaint  is referred to as the Plaintiff and the party it is filed counter to is referred to as the Defendant. According to the time frame ,established by Limitation Act , a plaint must be filed.

        <br>iii. Whether the accuser or perpetrator is not an adult i.e., he is a minor or is of unsound mind, a statement to such effect
        <br>iv. The proofs describing the cause of action and when it arose
        <br>v. A succinct report of the provisions or orders that invoke the Court's jurisdiction (subject)
        <br>v. Plaintiff's Opinions
        <br>vi. The relief claimed by the plaintiff
        <br>vii. Confirmation from the plaintiff that the information in the plaint is accurate and true.
        Additionally, in their case, a plaintiff may also act as their advocate. 
        <br><br>Drafting A Vakalatnama<br>
        After drafting the plaint, the plaintiff must give his advocate authorization to take on the opposing party in court via a written document known as the Vakalatnama.
        A Vakalatnama may contain the following (not an exhaustive list):
        <br>i. The client will not hold the advocate responsible for any decision
        <br>ii. The client will bear all the costs and/or any expenses incurred during the proceedings
        <br><br>Filing Of Plaint <br>
        The next step is to submit or file the plaint before the Chief Ministerial Officer (Sheristadar), and to do so, you must pay the necessary court fees and processing fees.

         <br><br><hr> (3) What is the statute of limitations for civil cases in India?
         <br>A limitation period is a part of legislation that controls the time period in which civil or criminal action can be carried against a defendant. Such statutes occur to shield defendants against biased legal proceedings.
         <br>The Limitation Act, 1859, and thereafter, the Limitation Act, 1963, were approved on October 5th, 1963, and went into effect on January 1st, 1964. The Limitation Act, 1963 articulates the laws pertaining to the law of restriction in India. These laws were created to consolidate and cure the legal customs relating to the restraint of lawsuit and other legal proceedings.
         <br>The Limitation Act is divided into 32 sections and 137 articles. The Articles have been divided into ten parts. The first segment deals with accounts; the second with gains; the third with statements; the fourth with notifications and instruments; the fifth with sustaining property etc. There is no universal restraint on the suits under which organisations have attempted to operate.
         <br><br><hr> (4) How are civil disputes typically resolved through alternative dispute resolution methods?
         <br>
        The Malimath committee along with the 29th report of the Law Commission proposed the idea of Conciliation as a technique of ADR. The primary purpose behind such an offer was to make the public aware of the options available to them for resolving their quarrels by operating the modes of Alternate Dispute Resolution. Consequently, it led to the enactment of Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure was endorsed through the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act 1999 and became effective from 01-07-2002. Thus, with the motive of bringing a significant reduction in the number of pending cases and its early disposition, Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure was amended. It provides the apparatus and procedure for settling the disputes of Civil Litigation through different mechanisms of ADR. The Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure states that:
        <br> 1. 	If the Court feels that there exist elements of a settlement that may be acceptable to the parties, the Court shall frame the terms of the settlement and give them to the parties for their observations .
        <br>2. If a dispute has been referred
        <br>·       for arbitration, the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall apply as if the accounts for arbitration or conciliation were referred for settlement under the provisions of that Act;
        <br>·       to Lok Adalat, the Court shall mention the same to the Lok Adalat in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 20 of the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 (39 of 1987) ;
        for mediation, the Court shall initiate a negotiation between the parties and shall follow such process as prescribed.

        (5) What legal remedies are available for breach of contract in civil law?
        <br>A contract can be said to be breached when one of the parties fails or refuses to achieve his obligations, or his ability under the contract.
        Parties to a contract are legally expected to perform their respective obligations, so naturally, the law frowns upon a breach by either party. Therefore, as soon as one party commits a breach of the contract, the law grants three legal remedies:
        <br>1. 	Damages for the loss sustained, or 
        <br>2. 	A decree for specific performance, or 
        <br>3. 	An injunction.
        <br>The laws linking to damages are governed by the Contract Act, whereas the laws relating to injunctions and specific performance are governed by the Specific Relief Act, 1963.

        <br>Equally, the terms may be subject to the country’s labor laws. Here, employers should note that India’s labor laws supersede the provisions of labor bonds—any termination policy or clause outlined within a contract should be checked against the law by a professional; and
        <br>In cases where there is no labor contract, or the labor contract does not define a method of termination, the matter comes under the jurisdiction of the detailed state’s labor legislation. This is because Indian federal law does not openly require that employment contracts be in written form.

<u>CONTRACT LAW</u><br><br>
(1) What are the essential elements of a valid contract, and why are they important?<br>
Contracts are agreements between parties in which one party gets a benefit and the other party receives consideration for it. They can be oral, written or implied. Parties entering into a contract may include common people, companies, nonprofit or government agencies.
<br><br>Offer<br>
The first step towards creation of a contract is an offer - it is when someone proposes to do or not to do something.<br>
An offer must be definite, clear and non ambiguous. It should be communicated accordingly to the other party. It should be lawful. <br><br>
Acceptance<br>
The second step is acceptance of that proposal, defined in section 2 (b) of the Act. <br>
Section 2 (b), Indian Contract Act states that when that person to whom the proposal was communicated to, gives assent for it , then he is said to have accepted the proposal.
Just like an offer, an acceptance of an offer should also be certain and clear.



<br><br><hr>
(2) How can someone draft a strong and legally binding contract for their business transactions?<br>

Some of the major prerequisite conditions, required to be fulfilled under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 for a contract to become a valid are:
<br>1.	An offer by one party;
<br>2.	An acceptance of the proposal by the other parties;
<br>3.	The capacity of all the parties to contract;
<br>4.	A lawful deliberation;
<br>5.	A legalized object; and
<br>6.	The contract not being expressly acknowledged void by law or be opposed to public policy.<br>
Once the requirements for the existence of a valid contract as mentioned under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 have been satisfied, the parties are said to have concluded a valid contract and are capable of legal enforcement.

<br><br><hr>
(3) How can someone legally terminate a contract without facing penalties?<br>
The Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract, 1872 defines contract as “an agreement enforceable by law” and Section 2(e) states that, “every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement”. This implies that all agreements are contracts.
The contract comes to an end when the parties have fulfilled their portion of promises and carried out their commitments. Section 37 of the Act mentions  that, “the parties to a contract must either perform or offer to perform, their respective promises, unless such performance is dispensed with or excused under the provisions of this Act, or any other law”. When the parties to a agreement perform their set of duties then the contract stands terminated.
If it becomes impossible to perform a contract then it leads to termination of the contract. The Section 56 makes provisions regarding the impossibility of contract. The contract could be impossible from the very commencement or it could become impossible subsequently upon some change in the following circumstances.
