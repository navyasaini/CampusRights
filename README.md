Problem statement: Digital Assistant for Legal Awareness and Designing a KYC framework in India

Description: Our project focuses on an educational website aiming to enhance legal awareness among citizens and provide guidance on India's Know Your Customer (KYC) framework. This website will serve as a comprehensive resource hub, offering a wide array of materials to help people understand legal concepts. Our user-friendly platform features an interactive UI, step-by-step guides, visual icons, user feedback, and voice search for accessibility. A notable feature of our initiative is its commitment to linguistic diversity, as we plan to offer the website in multiple languages, ensuring accessibility and inclusivity for a broader audience. By merging legal education with practical KYC guidance, our goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to make informed decisions within India's legal landscape. This initiative represents a significant step towards promoting legal literacy and empowering underprivileged and illiterate individuals. Continuous improvement will be achieved through partnerships with NGOs and community organisations
