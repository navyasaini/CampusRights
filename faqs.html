        <div class="content">
            <p>
                KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a process used by organizations, especially financial institutions, to verify the identities of their customers. It's vital for preventing financial crimes like money laundering and fraud, protecting institutions from legal and financial penalties, assessing customer risk, and maintaining trust in the financial system. KYC also ensures compliance with regulations, enhances cybersecurity, and safeguards customers from identity theft and fraud. In summary, KYC is essential for the integrity and security of financial transactions.
